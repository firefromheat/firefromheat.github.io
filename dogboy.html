    <p>"Dog Boy," ZillaKami's first solo studio album mainly focuses on his anger and issues with drugs. Zilla's issues are masked behind anger in the first part of the album, but the track “Not Worth It” shows his emotional distress leaking through.</p>
    <p>A couple tracks later, it’s back to angry, metal/rap bangers. After “Nissan Only,” though, it transitions fully to depressing and bleak stories such as the ones in "dedgrl" and "Space Cowboy," which I'll talk more about now.</p>
    <p>“Space Cowboy,” my favorite song on the album, tells the story of ZillaKami’s friend who killed himself. It’s a tragic song, but that’s what makes it so good.</p>
    <p>He tells the story from a perspective of not only the victim, but also from his own perspective, stating that he’s “part of the problem” and that “every night it starts to bother me” </p>
    <p>If you want bangers? This has it. If you want a story? This has it. If you want something to play while you’re really sad? This has it. 100% recommend, if you like the trap metal genre or are just looking for something new!</p>
