<p>"Favourite Track - Sisyphus"</p>
<p>"Least Favourite Track - WHERE'D YOU GO"</p>
<div>
    <p>Beautiful album. It revolves around a theme of climbing a mountain, whether that be a metaphorical one or a real one.</p>
    <p>Songs like “Smiling At The Ground” and “Sisyphus” are beautifully crafted pieces of art that I have both cried to, while songs like “Work!” and “Burnin Bridges/Long Day” are bangers that you can play at practically any time.</p>
    <p>The worst track on this album, "WHERE'D YOU GO" isn't even a bad song overall, it just doesn't fit with the album's themes.</p>
    <p>Overall, I really enjoyed this album and I recommend that you give it a try!</p>
