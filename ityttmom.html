<p>Least Favourite Track - and</p>
<div>
    <p>"i think you think too much of me" is Irish artist eden's second solo studio album, and has a vibe/feeling that I can only really describe as somber but hopeful.</p>
    <p>"fumes" and "xo" are both seemingly sad/somber songs but also have a feeling of happiness hiding in the background. </p>
    <p>My only issue is “and,” as it just falls flat comparatively to the other tracks. It’s not a bad song by any means, just nowhere close to the others on here.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Great album overall. eden has successfully created a sound of his own that nobody else has, and it seem's like he's mastered it in this release.</p>
