    <h1> Hi! Welcome to my page. Above you'll find a navigation bar to get to various subsections of the site. <br>
    "Home" is to get to this page from other pages. If you want to, for whatever reason. <br>
        "Work" is a couple selections from my recent work. <br>
    "About" is just an "About Me" page if you'd like to learn more about me! <br>
Lastly, "Contact" is if you'd like to contact me for any reason, really. <br> Thank you!</h1>
